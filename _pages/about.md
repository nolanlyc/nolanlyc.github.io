I'm a final-year MS student in ECE at UCSD. My research interests are DNN hardware accelerator design and computer architecture.

Research Project
======
**Graduate Student Researcher |     UCSD VVIP Lab      | 03/2024 – Present** 

Deep Learning Accelerator ASIC Tape-Out 
- Implemented an AI accelerator tailored for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models. 
- Mapped deep learning algorithms to datapath, including systolic array, softmax function, special function unit. 
- Developed a novel dataflow ISA for the accelerator, optimizing performance for systolic array based architectures. 
- Programmed an FSM micro-controller and asynchronous I/O interface for the AI accelerator to manage control signals 
and data flow. 
- Managed the entire RTL to GDS flow, including RTL design and verification, physical design and timing closure.

Professional Experience
======
**Physical Design and Timing Engineer |     Hisilicon Kirin SoC Team  | 03/2020 – 03/2023** 

Logic Synthesis and Physical Design 
- Led floorplanning and physical synthesis for the 5nm SoC subsystems (CPU/Media), focusing on PPA optimization 
and congestion prediction. 
- Conducted data-flow driven floorplanning, macro/pin placement for the media display module, achieving a 6% 
reduction in Low-Vth cell usage and mitigating congestion risks. 
- Reduced the leakage power of CPU little core by 5% by utilizing MCMM synthesis and the Multi-Vth cell strategy. 
- Executed partition level PnR flow including floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and DRC fixing. 

Static-Timing Analysis
- Owned SoC subsystems timing closure and sign-off. Experienced with STA considering PVT corner, timing margins, 
process variations, signal integrity, and multi-power domains. 
- Developed timing constraints for clock domain crossing, exception, block I/O timing, and multi-voltage design, 
achieving timing closure for a complex SoC submodule. 
- Developed a performance prediction model across different technology nodes, voltages and Low-Vth cell percentages.
